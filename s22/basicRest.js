//Exercise:
/*
    Use the existing code discussion.
    Create an endpoint called “/profile”.
    Use HTTP method “POST”.
    Create a response with a statement “Data to be send to the database”
    For the endpoint doesn’t exist, send a response “Request Cannot Be Completed”.
    Ensure that the endpoint is running on PostMan.
