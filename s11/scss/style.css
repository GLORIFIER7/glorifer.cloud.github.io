    What do the mixins do? Avoid writing media query over and over again
    They provide a semantic media query mixin for the following:
    Respond above XX.
    Respond below XX.
    Respond between XX and XX.
    Where XX is the two letter Bootstrap breakpoint (i.e. sm, md).
    Usual way: @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {
        Target devices between 768px and 992px. 
    }

*/
/*
    It’s best practice to use Bootstrap’s breakpoints in your own code but it’s painful to write them all the time. To get around that I use a Sass map of values:
*/
/*
    This means the breakpoint values are only ever written once. Map values like these can be accessed using the Sass' map-get function:
*/
/*
    Before going ahead and writing the media query it’s a good idea to ensure the key exists in the $breakpoints map in case you make a typo (i.e. @include respond-above(small)).
    To do this we use Sass' map-has-key function
